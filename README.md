# Practical guide to ML System design

This is a technical guide to the key principles of building enterprise-level machine learning applications for ML leaderds. It assumes that you have a solid technical foundation in machine learning and that you wish to strengthen your strategic approaches to developing ML applications. This brochure describes a framework for making key technical decisions throughout the lifecycle of your project. It does not explore the nuances of specific ML algorithms but focuses on algorithm-agnostic (mostly) challenges that are common in industrial ML.
