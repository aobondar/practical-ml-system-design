# Practical guide to ML System design

This is a technical guide to the key principles of building enterprise-level machine learning applications for ML leaders. It assumes that you have a solid technical foundation in machine learning and that you wish to strengthen your strategic approaches to developing ML applications. It is also useful for business leaders who want to ensure their engineering teams are on the right track. This brochure describes a framework for making key technical decisions throughout the lifecycle of your project. It does not explore the nuances of specific ML algorithms but focuses on algorithm-agnostic (mostly) challenges that are common in industrial ML.

The text is structured to reflect the importance of different aspects of ML in descending order of significance and to align with the project lifecycle, guiding you from early to later stages of decision-making.
