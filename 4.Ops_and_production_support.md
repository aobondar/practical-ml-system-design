# What does operation means:
* You want to make sure system is working as intended
* So you want to have actionable analytics, which have OK / not OK states.
* You want to quickly figure out root-cause of your problem - so you make analytics to do that
* You want to actually prevent degradations so you want to find leading metrics, which fire alarm before it's too late
* You design fallback logic to limit incedent consequences
