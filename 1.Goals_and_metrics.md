## 1.1 Mindset

One of the most important characteristics of the mindset that distinguishes a strong machine learning engineer with a solid grasp of systems design from a novice is the ability to see the problem through the eyes of an entrepreneur at the outset of addressing a challenge. In a large enterprise, this can be difficult, as engineers typically have business leaders who take on the responsibility for results—sometimes without fully understanding what they are committing to. In a startup, the scale of decisions is usually not significant enough for engineers to genuinely feel the weight of responsibility for their engineering choices. 

You are fortunate if your manager or the environment within your company fosters accountability for results from the first draft through to the end of the product’s lifecycle. In such cases, you naturally accumulate the principles we will discuss below. Otherwise, for your professional growth, you must independently cultivate this perspective on your work. Specifically:

You are an operational leader tasked with solving a business problem (achieving the greatest effect for the least amount of money). It just so happens that, in addition to people management practices, you have at your disposal the ability to create somewhat simplistic but highly diligent robots.

This concept allows you to:
- **Avoid viewing machine learning as the only possible solution.** Sometimes it is cheaper to hire several people. Instead of a recommendation system, you might establish a content department for curating selections. Rather than implementing a search engine, you could assign a person to manage the support chat window. Any machine learning problem can also be solved with human effort. It all comes down to the total PnL of the project.
- **Choose the most cost-effective method among all available machine learning approaches.** This directly enhances the PnL of your business project.
- **Not only integrate machine learning into the product and operational processes but also adapt those processes and products to accommodate machine learning.** TikTok’s recommendations would not be as impressive if not for the very form of the product. Implementing active learning is impossible without restructuring business processes to support it.
- **Carefully consider operational support for the solution and manage edge cases.** You are responsible for the overall outcome, which means all project issues are your responsibility.

The remainder of this brochure applies this mindset to practical scenarios.
