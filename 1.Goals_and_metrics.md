# 1. Goals and metrics

## 1.1 Mindset

One of the key traits that sets a strong machine learning engineer with a solid understanding of systems design apart from a novice is the ability to approach problems from an entrepreneur's perspective right from the start. In a large enterprise, this can be challenging, as engineers often have business leaders who assume responsibility for results—sometimes without fully understanding what they are getting into. In a startup, the scale of decisions is typically not large enough for engineers to truly feel the weight of responsibility for their engineering choices.

You are fortunate if your manager or the culture within your company encourages accountability for results from the initial draft through to the product's entire lifecycle. In such environments, you naturally absorb the principles we will discuss below. Otherwise, for your professional development, you need to actively cultivate this perspective on your work. Specifically:

> You are an operational leader tasked with a business problem (maximizing impact while minimizing costs). It just so happens that, in addition to people management skills, you also have the capability to create somewhat stupid but highly diligent robots in your toolbox.

This concept allows you to:
- **Avoid viewing machine learning as the sole solution.** Sometimes, it’s more cost-effective to hire multiple people. Instead of developing a recommendation system, you might set up a content team to curate selections. Rather than implementing a search engine, you could assign someone to handle the support chat. Any machine learning problem can also be tackled with human effort. Ultimately, it all comes down to the sign before project's overall PnL.
- **Select the most cost-efficient method among all available machine learning approaches.** Because this decision directly affects the PnL of your business project.
- **Not only integrate machine learning into products and operational processes but also adapt those processes and products to better support machine learning.** TikTok’s recommendations wouldn’t be as effective without the inherent design of the product. Implementing active learning is impractical without restructuring business processes to accommodate it.
- **Thoughtfully consider operational support for the solution and manage edge cases.** You are responsible for the overall outcome over the time, which means that all issues related to the project fall under your purview.

The remainder of this brochure applies this mindset to practical scenarios.

## 1.2 Goal

In real-world scenarios, engineers often receive requests like, "Could you please create a model that does X?" However, it’s important to trace those requests back to the original problem. For example:

- *"I need a recommendation system"* really means "I want to increase sales through more personalized offers."
- *"I need a classifier for NSFW content"* translates to "I want to reduce the number of incidents involving inappropriate content in our user-generated content system."
- *"I need a RAG system for our headquarters"* indicates "I want to cut down the time employees spend searching our intranet."

Understanding the underlying goals provides you with more flexibility and a higher chance of success.

Even if a business stakeholder presents a solid design idea, you still need a clear definition of the ultimate goal to:

- Prioritize the initiative relative to other opportunities and ensure it aligns with core business objectives.
- Analyze in detail the potential effects that could be achieved by building an ideal model with 100% accuracy.
- Estimate the financial impact to eliminate solutions that would lead to negative profitability.
- Develop a metrics system for tracking your progress and assessing the overall impact.
- Rapidly create a quick and rough prototype as a baseline for your model during its development.
- And, importantly, evaluate whether you ethically agree to undertake the task.

While all of this may seem obvious, it is surprisingly easy to lose sight of the original goal and become distracted by secondary objectives. It’s best to avoid this pitfall to prevent pouring time and effort into a project that ultimately benefits no one.
