# 1. Goals and metrics

## 1.1 Mindset

One of the key traits that sets a strong machine learning engineer with a solid understanding of systems design apart from a novice is the ability to approach problems from an entrepreneur's perspective right from the start. In a large enterprise, this can be challenging, as engineers often have business leaders who assume responsibility for results (sometimes without fully understanding the consiquences of their decisions). In a startup, the scale of decisions is typically not large enough for engineers to truly feel the weight of responsibility for their engineering choices.

You are fortunate if your manager or the culture within your company encourages accountability for results from the initial draft through to the product's entire lifecycle. In such environments, you naturally absorb the principles we will discuss below. Otherwise, for your professional development, you need to actively cultivate this perspective on your work. And the "mantra" is:

> You are an business leader tasked with a business problem (maximizing impact while minimizing costs). It just so happens that, in addition to people management skills, you also have the capability to do ML.

This concept allows you to:
- **Avoid viewing machine learning as the sole solution.** Sometimes, it’s more cost-effective to hire multiple people. Instead of developing a recommendation system, you might set up a content team to curate selections. Rather than implementing a search engine, you could assign someone to handle the support chat. Any machine learning problem can also be tackled with human effort. Ultimately, it all comes down to the sign before project's overall PnL.
- **Select the most cost-efficient method among all available machine learning approaches.** Because this decision directly affects the PnL of your business project.
- **Not only integrate machine learning into products and operational processes but also adapt those processes and products to better support machine learning.** TikTok’s recommendations wouldn’t be as effective without the inherent design of the product. Implementing active learning is impractical without restructuring business processes to accommodate it.
- **Thoughtfully consider operational support for the solution and manage edge cases.** You are responsible for the overall outcome over the time, which means that all issues related to the project fall under your purview.

The remainder of this brochure applies this mindset to practical scenarios.

## 1.2 Goal

In real-world scenarios, engineers often receive requests like, "Could you please create a model that does X?" However, it’s important to trace those requests back to the original problem. For example:

- *"I need a recommendation system"* really means "I want to increase sales through more personalized offers."
- *"I need a classifier for NSFW content"* translates to "I want to reduce the number of incidents involving inappropriate content in our user-generated content system."
- *"I need a RAG system for our headquarters"* indicates "I want to cut down the time employees spend searching our intranet."

Understanding the underlying goals provides you with more flexibility and a higher chance of success.

Even if a business stakeholder presents a solid design idea, you still need a clear definition of the ultimate goal to:

- Prioritize the initiative relative to other opportunities and ensure it aligns with core business objectives.
- Analyze in detail the potential effects that could be achieved by building an ideal model with 100% accuracy.
- Estimate the financial impact to eliminate solutions that would lead to negative profitability.
- Develop a metrics system for tracking your progress and assessing the overall impact.
- Rapidly create a quick and rough prototype (often non-ML) as a baseline for your model during its development.
- And, importantly, evaluate whether you ethically agree to undertake the task.

While all of this may seem obvious, it is surprisingly easy to lose sight of the original goal and become distracted by secondary objectives. It’s best to avoid this pitfall to prevent pouring time and effort into a project that ultimately benefits no one. 

In commercial organizations, the primary goal is to generate profits, which means your objectives will likely fall into one of the following categories:

- **Increase Revenue**: This can entail launching paid ML-based services for B2B or B2C markets or adopting systems that enhance sales through personalization or uplift modeling. Ultimately, the success hinges on the direct revenue generated by these solutions. This objective is key when the company has high profit margins or aims at market expansion. In high-margin scenarios, increased revenue directly boosts the company's profits — common in the software industry where logistic expensess doesn't grow linearly after sales volume. Conversely, in market expansion, higher revenue might initially result in losses; however, stakeholders anticipate that this strategy will lead to market dominance, enabling the company to raise prices and recover the early losses.

- **Save Money**: For instance, by automating routine tasks in call centers or document management processes. This goal is important for large, traditional businesses with low profit margins, where each additional dollar in sales yields only a few extra cents in profit. In these cases, focusing on efficiency can yield significantly greater returns. In real-world scenarios, measuring the effects of automation is not straightforward. You either need to maintain two versions of the business process: one with automation and one without (which can be costly), or you make hypothetical assumptions about "how much more money we would spend without automation" (which can be quite theoretical). A more or less honest evaluation can be done by comparing the EBITDA of our company to industrial benchmarks, but it obviously doesn’t provide clear insights into which particular projects provided this effect.

- **Grow active userbase**: This usually involves developing systems that engage and retain users within a product, with the plan to eventually monetize through other paid services. If the initiative is new, the link between user retention and future revenue heavily depends on management's beliefs. For more mature initiatives, these ecosystem effects are typically well-calculated. In such projects, it is essential to acknowledge that there will come a day when stakeholders ask, "Are we really making money from this?" This question is worth considering from the outset.

Ultimately, especially over a horizon of five to ten years, the results of your work will be judged based on their impact on the financial health of the company. During periods of economic growth, stakeholders tend to trust projects that promise returns over time or indirectly. In times of economic downturn, they will be more inclined to support projects that generate immediate revenue. However, in the end, every project will be evaluated through its effect on financial streams, which is something to keep in mind when designing a new and exciting system.

## 1.3 Metrics

Once you have a clear understanding of your goal, it’s important to establish a metric to track the impact of your work on the business. A good metric should:

* **Objectively measure the effect**. Both you and your stakeholders should view this metric as an objective measure of success. It’s crucial to align on this from the very beginning and update any agreements regarding the metrics if things change. The closer the metric is to actual revenue, the easier it will be for you to assess its real impact on the business. Conversely, the further the metric is from financial outcomes, the more you will rely on stakeholders' beliefs about the connection between the metric and an actual effect.

* **Allow for effect attribution to specific systems**. This means you should be able to clearly identify how much of the change in the metric was caused by your system, excluding external factors. Specifically, if you can conduct A/B tests of your system with statistical significance, you can accurately determine your impact. Any other approaches to measuring your system’s effect on metrics are susceptible to external influences and should be used with great caution.
