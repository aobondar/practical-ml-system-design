What to cover:

- Narrowing down your hypothesis space and 'unknown zone' (on RAG and Agents examples). Recsys (on )
RAG: requests space? which type of index? what documents base? take existing or rewrite? summarizer? hyperparameters?
Recsys: are there good signals? what are the features? what is the model architecture?
LLM: can we do distributed training? do we have clean anough dataset? which data is required? ect
Search: ----
Agents: are working at all? Can we distignuish good and bad answers? Which model to take? Which tools?

Two ways for efficiency:
* reduce your hypothesys space by analytics (recsys - corellations, nlp - annotate examples)
* speed up you experiments cycle

Estimate and setup quick iteration speed. Fastest: online metrics with quick feedback, slow online metrics / slow criteria + fast offline. Slow online, slow release cycle, slow offline - not much experiments, makes sense to have something more straightforward. Fast experiments = more risky approaches.

What R&D roadmap is:
- hypothesis list (implement & run or analyze)
- improvements of experiments setup
- delivery to production
