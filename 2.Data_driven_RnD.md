What to cover:

- Narrowing down your hypothesis space and 'unknown zone' (on RAG and Agents examples). Recsys (on )
RAG: requests space? which type of index? what documents base? take existing or rewrite? summarizer? hyperparameters?
Recsys: are there good signals? what are the features? what is the model architecture?
LLM: can we do distributed training? do we have clean anough dataset? which data is required? ect
Search: ----
Agents: are working at all? Can we distignuish good and bad answers? Which model to take? Which tools?

Is it important at all?
- Horizontal (make a solution for a whole problem, and then improve overall) approach to R&D. Recommendations. Search engines. Moderation systems. Foundational models development.
- Vertical (take smaller problem, and then do scaling). Chatbots (RAG, Agents). Recommendations??. Process automation (trigger-based suggests?). Recsys (also triggers).

Roadmaps:
- Problem-centric vs feature centric. Pros and cons.
